# Chatbot-Seq2Seq
A Chatbot which is an application Deep Natural Language Processing built using tensorflow. 

The Natural Language Processing Models are not able to mimic the human brain, the End to End Deep Learning Models developed. Self Organizing Maps which is used for Feature Extraction, Deep Boltzmann Machines and variations, Auto Encoders are developed. A combination of NLP with Deep Learning Models like Auto Encoders gives good predictions. 

As the sequence of info is discarded in the basic Bag of Words model, Seq2Seq models to mimic similar to human brain with enhancements like using LSTM's(to overcome Vanishing Gradient Descent), Encoders, Decoders, Transformers(Bert - Stack of Encoders Layers) are used. This is an instance of it. 

Happy Learning :)
